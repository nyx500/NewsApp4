def preprocessTextForFastTextEmbeddings(text):
    """
    - A basic text preprocessing function required before extracting the fastText dense embeddings.
    - It only cleans text from extra whitespace and newlines, as well as lowercasing,
    in preparation for training a fastText model, as this model cannot handle newlines and trailing spaces.
    -  It does not remove punctuation as based on feature analysis, this can be an important distinguishing factor for fake news,
    as shown before in the EDA.
    - It does not remove stopwords because they could be important to fastText model, which has been autotuned to poss. include
    n-grams (bi/trigrams), where stopwords can be important to determining meaning of phrasal verb patterns, collocations etc.
    - Also does not aggressively apply normalization (lemmatize/stemming) words as extraction and comparison of morphemes
    and subword components is automatically handled by the FastText model.
